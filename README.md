# dummy_application

This project is Santa's children app where Santa maintains a list of children describing them as naughty or nice.

flutter version: 3.13.9 
device: IOS simulator

Packages: 
getx
google_fonts

I've used getx as state management for this project as I feel getx is fast and light. one of the major advantage that 
I feel getx offers is that it doesn't follow the flow of context in flutter apps.

I defined a centralised theme a little as well 

possibly I could have managed the state more efficiently but as I had time restriction I couldn't do it.
I've completed the project in an hour and a half!

thanks,
Satyam Tiwari.
